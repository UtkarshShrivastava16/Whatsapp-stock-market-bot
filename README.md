# Whatsapp-stock-market-bot

The project is aimed at providing a stock market information service to people in remote areas (where only low data bandwidth is accessible). This is enabled by the means of whatsapp text messages.<br />
<br />
***Input taken by the service provider:*** <br />
The selenium bot program takes a list of stocks and contacts as an input.<br />
<br />
***Output provided to the contact:*** <br />
The given contacts are messaged with a detailed and well formatted information about the enlisted stocks.<br />
<br />
***Future Scope:***<br />
1. Given that the sender dosen't close the server, the stock prices can be scheduled and sent throughout the day.<br />
2. The stocks can also be listed based on the receiver's demand.<br />
3. Investments can be done using third party API's by the means of subscription.<br />
<br />
All of the following can be attained by the means of whatsapp only, given the constraint of low bandwidth connection or lack of sufficient data.
